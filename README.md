# JA Sales Helper - Sales Tracker for Junior Achievement Companies

# About
JA Sales Helper is a Java application meant to trivialize the task of collecting sales data for students in the Junior Achievement Company Program. Using a user-friendly GUI, JA Sales Helper provides a seamless data entry experience while reducing the risk of erronous data entries. Initially developed because I was fed up with my Junior Achievement Company accounting methods and I thought there had to be a better and more modern way to track sales data. This project was also a good way for me to give back to the Junior Achievement Company Program and maybe it will help out some students in the future :)

# Features
- Add/Remove Products 
- Open/Save Sales Data files (.csv integration)
- Simple and efficient GUI allows for easy tracking of customer sales data
- Object Oriented Design

# Future Considerations
- Import Products List (if company has many different types of products)
- System Log of Past Actions
- Port from Java Application to Web Application (Much easier usability if hosted on website, many students don't know how to run a Java application but can access a website easily)
